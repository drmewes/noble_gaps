|      You have enabled k-point parallelism (KPAR>1).                         |
|      This developmental code was originally  written by Paul Kent at ORNL,  |
|      and carefully double checked in Vienna.                                |
|      GW as well as linear response parallelism added by Martijn Marsman     |
|      and Georg Kresse.                                                      |
|      Carefully verify results versus KPAR=1.                                |
|      Report problems to Paul Kent and Vienna.                               |

|      You have switched on METAGGA and linear response routines.             |
|      This combination is currently not supported.                           |
|      If you have selected LOPTICS=.TRUE., VASP will continue but some       |
|      matrix elements [H,r] are neglected   (you might try to use            |
|      LPEAD=.TRUE. which works irrespective of H).                           |
|      In all other cases VASP will stop now. SOOO sorry...                   |
