|      You have enabled k-point parallelism (KPAR>1).                         |
|      This developmental code was originally  written by Paul Kent at ORNL,  |
|      and carefully double checked in Vienna.                                |
|      GW as well as linear response parallelism added by Martijn Marsman     |
|      and Georg Kresse.                                                      |
|      Carefully verify results versus KPAR=1.                                |
|      Report problems to Paul Kent and Vienna.                               |
