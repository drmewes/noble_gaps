|      You have enabled k-point parallelism (KPAR>1).                         |
|      This developmental code was originally  written by Paul Kent at ORNL,  |
|      and carefully double checked in Vienna.                                |
|      GW as well as linear response parallelism added by Martijn Marsman     |
|      and Georg Kresse.                                                      |
|      Carefully verify results versus KPAR=1.                                |
|      Report problems to Paul Kent and Vienna.                               |

|      Your generating k-point grid is not commensurate to the symmetry       |
|      of the lattice.  This can cause   slow convergence with respect        |
|      to k-points for HF type calculations                                   |
|      suggested SOLUTIONS:                                                   |
|       ) if not already the case, use automatic k-point generation           |
|       ) shift your grid to Gamma (G) (e.g. required for hex or fcc lattice) |
|                                                                             |
