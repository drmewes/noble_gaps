|      For optimal performance we recommend to set                            |
|        NCORE= 4 - approx SQRT( number of cores)                             |
|      NCORE specifies how many cores store one orbital (NPAR=cpu/NCORE).     |
|      This setting can  greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.     |
|      The default,   NCORE=1            might be grossly inefficient         |
|      on modern multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines.     |
|      Do your own testing !!!!                                               |
|      Unfortunately you need to use the default for GW and RPA calculations. |
|      (for HF NCORE is supported but not extensively tested yet)             |
|                                                                             |

|      This developmental code was originally  written by Paul Kent at ORNL,  |
|      and carefully double checked in Vienna.                                |
|      GW as well as linear response parallelism added by Martijn Marsman     |
|      and Georg Kresse.                                                      |
|      Carefully verify results versus KPAR=1.                                |

|      You have a very small band gap. This results in slow convergence       |
|      of the energy with respect to NOMEGA                                   |
|      Usually VASP defaults OMEGAMIN to the bandgap which guarantees an      |
|      optimal grid for OMEGAGRID=140.                                        |
|      The gap was found to be OMEGAMIN= 0.0100                               |
|      Now OMEGAMIN is set to 0.02 instead, which effectively removes some    |
|      excitations from the spectrum.                                         |
|      You can set OMEGAMIN manually in the INCAR, however.                   |
|                                                                             |
